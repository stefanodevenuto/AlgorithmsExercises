This script tests the performances of a solution to 
exercise 4. The scripts assumes:

  - that it is run on the directory containing the folders with
    the inputs/outputs provided as tests (i.e., it assumes that
    it there exists test1, test2, ..., test11 subdirs in the current
    directory).
  - that the program implementing the solution is called 'oc', but you
    may specify another name as the first parameter to the script
  - that the program implementing the solution takes two arguments:
         - the name of the input file
         - the name of the output file
    and behaves accordingly (i.e., reads from the input file and writes
    onto the output file).

For each test directory the script runs `oc`, checks if the solution is
correct and reports the performances. If the solution is *not* correct
it also reports the first few lines of the diff between the correct 
and the calculated solutions.

This script requires the 'ansi_colors' ruby gem. You can install it
with the command: `gem install ansi_colors`.

If everything is ok, you should get a colored output containing the 
the following contents (assuming the solution solves correctly all
tests in less than two seconds):

Testing executable:bin/oc
time for    test1: Ok (0.37711 secs)
time for    test2: Ok (0.14862 secs)
